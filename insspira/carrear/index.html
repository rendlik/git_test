                        <p>But we're also in love with the kind of people who don't fit into a specific box - yet are eager
                            to learn, do and be whatever it takes to create magic. If that sounds like you, this is your

                            in British Columbia, or the pristine Vancouver beach overlooking it. Our office is also 20 minutes
                            away from Cypress mountain and 60 minutes from Whistler - the biggest ski resort town in North
                            America. It's also a quick drive away from breathtaking attractions like Stately Park, Capilano
                            Suspension Bridge, and Grouse mountain. You'll love it out here.</p>

                        <p>One of the world's biggest companies famously tells new recruits there's no such thing as work-life
                            balance: your work is your life. Insspira thinks differently. We believe it's important to live
                            a rich, layered life - whether it's spending time with your kids, or breaking records in one
                            of our nearby ski resorts. Oh, and there is no honor to be found in working late nights. We'd
                            rather you go home and get your rest!</p>

                        <p>Insspira resonates with those who believe having an epic mission is more important than having a
                            job. That means brilliant people who don't fit in a box. Inspirational people who remind you
                            what you're really capable of. And sometimes, slightly weird people with a taste for practical
                            jokes and offbeat humor. Don't say we didn't warn you :)</p>
