          <h2 class="rn"> Running </h2>
          <p> I totally love running, cause it gives me freedom. I love the simplicity of running, all you need are the shoes, shorts and T-shirt stepping out and run. There is almost no place, where it is impossible to run.  </p>

        	<h2 class="rd"> Reading </h2>
        	<p> Reading gives us the knowledge. Read and you don't need to spend all those years at school. There is almost nothing better than a good book. </p>

        	<h2 class="tr"> Traveling </h2>
        	<p> I have visited over 30 countries. I always compare it with my university studies and I am still not sure what is more important for me. Anyway I would like to encourage everyone to travel as much as possible.  </p>
